        <h1> Mini Project On HTML & CSS </h1> <hr> 
        <h3> Read the given instuction given below before doing your project</h3> <hr> 
        <ul>
            <li>The project for your HTML & CSS will be a <span>"mini-website."</span> 
                Choose a topic that interests you: something that excites you, something you want to tell the whole
                world about. If you don't care about the subject, your readers won't either.</li>
                <br>
            <li>I want you to concentrate on the HTML, not on finding content, so do not choose a topic that requires
                lots of research. For example, unless are an expert about the subject, a web site about the kings of 
                Sweden will need much time-consuming research. On the other hand a website about your favorite hobby 
                won't take much research at all.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Here are further requirements for the assignment: </h3> <hr>

        
            <ol>
                <li>Your project must contain a minimum of ten original HTML5 pages (files) that you have written.
                    A single HTML5 file with links to nine pages written by other people is not acceptable. You may not
                    simply link to pages that you have practiced for the HTML & CSS. Your material must all be original.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Diagram showing links among an index page and other content pages is shown in the <b>Sample linkage
                     diagram.</b></li> <b>Example:</b>
                <a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/87d5e37be990553291560db32ded703e9b80634b9291a1fca1f8f8aa547f4e22/68747470733a">
                    <img src="" /> </a>
                 
                <li>You must draw a diagram showing how your HTML pages link together, and the linkage must make sense.
                    For the linkage diagram you can use any online tools to draw or you can make your diagram by hand
                    then scan it or take a digital photo of the diagram and upload it to the <span>GitHub.</span> </li> 
                <br> 
                    <b>Notes:</b> A  A linkage diagram is not the same as a diagram showing. If you have many pages
                    that are all linked to each other, just draw a line that connects them all and label it with words
                    like “all linked to each other” rather than trying to draw dozens of lines with arrows on them. <br>
                <br>
                <li>Implementation of your project: </li>

                            you can't have all your pages saying <span>&lt;title&gt;</span> My Project 
                            <span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>).</li>
